<Body> 
<P>I was born and raised in the state of Maine.I have traveled quite a bit in my life having gone to many areas of the United States and parts of europe. I like to play tennis and swim. For enjoyment I like to play board games, video games, and go hiking. I have two sibling who also attended the University of Maine, and who have now graduated and go on with their lives. Both were in the Honor College which is what inspired me to go to this university and attend the Honors College. The Honors College has been an amazing experience that has been very enjoyable. The Honors College has played a huge roll in my life since I came to the University of Maine in the Fall of 2014 as a freshman. I started off as a student in the Biology program, but later changed majors to Management after struggling with a couple classes. </P>
